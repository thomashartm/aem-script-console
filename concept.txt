Implementation Agenda:
- Standard groovy and js editor and runner (default)
- Script library
- Proper access control (only users with certain authorization level) / hide resourceResolverFactory and provide authenticated access to it
- Read only executor service that triggers already existing, preconfigred
scripts and evaluate input parameters (requets params) passed into the script
