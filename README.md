# AEM  Groovy Script Console

![Editor View](https://travis-ci.org/thomashartm/aem-script-console.svg?branch=master "Travis CI")

With the AEM script console technical and non technical users can easily execute custom groovy scripts in the context of AEM e.g. to fix or migrate content.

The console supports the execution of stored or submitted groovy scripts. 
Therefore the console has an editor view to define the script and a script runner UI that allows to start a stored script without having to deal with an editng interface.
